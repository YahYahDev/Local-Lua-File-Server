Local-Lua-File-Server:

	A work and progress file server writen in lua using lua-socket


Dependencys:

	Note: the default configuration does not support windows, please see Server/Plugs/Default.plug
		  and Modules/Std/StdDir.lua if you want to change it to support being used on windows

	1): lua 5.2+ and maby luajit with a little tweaking

	2): lua-socket https://lunarmodules.github.io/luasocket/




Log:

	Note: the log logs everything in a 'Log' file and doesnt not make any seperate files
		  if your needs require multiple 'Log' files then the modules for it is in the following
		  /src/Modules/Std/Log.lua

	Doc:

		'log:Add(msg)' put a string you want to log in msg and it will log in Log.log

		'log:Error(msg)' put a string you want to log in msg and it will log in Log.log

		'duplicate logs' all duplicate logs are expressed as a ... at the end of the message




Plugs:

	Note: the plug system is a system to load lua functions at run time in the server
		  every interaction a client can do is through a plug to add plugs make a .plug file
		  in /src/Server/Plugs/whateveryouwant.plug

	Doc: please reference Default.plug for how to make a plugin


Configuration:

	Note: the config format goes [key] = [value1, value2, ect]
		  no multiline key value pairs and no commits for the time being,

	Example:
		```
		[whitelist] = [localhost, FriendsIpAddress, FamiliysIpAddress]
		[port] = [8888]
		[directory] = [/home/user/FileServer/Directory/]
		[ip] = [localhost]
		[plugdir] = [Server/Plugs]

		```

	1): 'directory' should be the absolute path to the root folder of the github repo

	2): 'whitelist' should be a list of [ips, you, want] to allow to accesse the server

	3): 'port' should be the port you have open for connections

	4): 'ip' should be the ip you want to connect to as a client

	5); 'plugdir' should be the path to plugins for the server.
			should not need  to change from default
			as long as the project structure is default


TODO:

	1): Pack dependencys with git repo or in the "make script"

	2): Implement Server:HandleInput()
