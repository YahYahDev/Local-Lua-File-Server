Local-Lua-File-Server:

	A work and progress file server writen in lua using lua-socket


Dependencys:

	Note: only works on systems that have the following commands "ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm -r"
		  this is because of the file "src/Modules/Std/StdDir.lua" if you dont have the commands from above just remap to what you need them to be.


	1): lua 5.1 or above

	2): lua-socket https://lunarmodules.github.io/luasocket/



TODO:

	1): Pack dependencys with git repo or in the "make script"
