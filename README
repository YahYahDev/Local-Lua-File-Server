Local-Lua-File-Server:

	A work and progress file server writen in lua using lua-socket


Dependencys:

	Note: the default configuration does not support windows, please see Server/Plugs/Default.plug
		  and Modules/Std/StdDir.lua if you want to change it to support being used on windows

	1): lua 5.2+ and maby luajit with a little tweaking

	2): lua-socket https://lunarmodules.github.io/luasocket/




Log:
	Note: the log logs everything in a 'Log' file and doesnt not make any seperate files
		  if your needs require multiple 'Log' files then the modules for it is in the following
		  /src/Modules/Std/Log.lua


Plugs:
	Note: the plug system is a system to load lua functions at run time in the server
		  every interaction a client can do is through a plug to add plugs make a .plug file
		  in /src/Server/Plugs/whateveryouwant.plug


Configuration:

	Note: the config format goes [key] = [value1, value2, ect]
		  no multiline key value pairs and no commits for the time being,

	Example:
		```
		[whitelist] = [localhost, FriendsIpAddress, FamiliysIpAddress]
		[port] = [8888]
		[directory] = [/home/user/FileServer/Directory/]

		```

	1): 'directory' should be the absolute path to a folder you want the server to have accesse to.

	2): 'whitelist' should be a list of [to be implemented] id's to allow to accesse the server

	3): 'port' should be the port you have open for connections




TODO:

	1): Pack dependencys with git repo or in the "make script"

	2): Implement Server:HandleInput()

	3): Make duplicate loging errors/messages stack insted of having a new line for every error/message
